In 2015 the Arlington Career Center partnered with Monarch Sister Schools 
Project to educate our students about the precarious status of the monarch 
butterfly and to implement some local solutions. Through the Sister Schools 
Project, classes have the opportunity to communicate using telecommunications 
with students who are endeavoring to plant oyamel trees in Michoacan Province, 
Mexico. Many of the oyamel fir trees on which monarchs overwinter have been 
logged over the years.

In the fall of 2015, students and staff worked together to establish a 150 sq. 
ft. garden, located at the corner of Highland Street and the school parking 
lot. Students planted the garden with milkweeds and other native nectar 
plants (A list of these plants can be found under the link Native Plants on 
this website). Students also applied for certification with Monarch Watch to 
designate our garden as an official “Monarch Waystation”. The first phase of 
the Monarch Project invited collaboration among several Arlington Career 
Center classes. These included:

<ul>
  <li>Digging of garden: ACC staff and some students from the Program for 
  Employment Preparedness (PEP) and Early Childhood Education</li>
  <li>Garden Plan: HILT students from Ms. Maskelony’s geometry class</li>

  <li>Garden Planting: PEP students, Arlington Community High School 
  students, and HILT students</li>

  <li>Fencing: Students in Sustainable Technologies class</li>

  <li>Plant Signage: PEP students and Animal Science class</li>

</ul>

<p>Several caterpillars also developed in cages in the ACC main office, 
for all students to see.
</p>

<p>In the winter of 2016, HILT Program students assumed an important 
leadership role for the Project when they created a Powerpoint about the 
Project, which they shared via SKYPE with students in Mexico. Students took 
turns describing to Mexican students what we had done and showing their Power 
Point.
</p>

<p>While we saw a drop in Monarch populations in the 2016-17 year, due to 
several storms which caused severe damage to the Biosphere, we are hopeful to 
find monarch eggs and larvae on our own milkweed plants in 2017. Our goal is 
to involve as many classes in rearing butterflies as we can.
