# Arlington Career Center Monarch Butterfly Project 

We love [Monarch butterflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly)
at the [Arlington Career Center](https://careercenter.apsva.us/).  This website
documents our interdisciplinary project involving the study of these
amazing insects. Our project involves students from our sustainable
technologies, science, geometry, English, animal science, early childhood
education, and special education classes.
