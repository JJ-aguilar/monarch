<h2>World Issues</h2>

<p>Over the past 50 years, scientists have been recording 
steady drops in the monarch populations, particularly with 
the Eastern North American population which completes the 
miraculous 2,000 mile annual migration previously described. 
Many factors contribute to the drop in numbers. We will 
briefly describe the most critical factors:
</p>

<h2><u> Habitat Loss in In Mexico:</u></h2>

<p> In Mexico, drastic habitat losses have occurred on 
many levels. Since Dr. Fred Urquhart first deciphered the 
monarch migration to Mexico in the early 1970’s 
(prior to his research no one knew where the monarchs 
had gone), an alarming reduction of the oyamel forest 
sanctuary has occurred, primarily due to logging. This 
protected natural area of the monarch butterfly was 
established in 1980 by the Mexican government to 
protect the overwintering sites. Since the decree was 
largely ineffective, the government established the Monarch 
Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve in 1986. The new decree 
protected land used by 5 monarch colonies, a total area of 
16,110 hectares, or acres.</p>

<p>
The government prohibits logging in the “core” zone of the 
Biosphere and regulates logging in a buffer zone. Since the 
legislation did not factor in the natural movement of 
colonies in February and March (as they prepare to migrate 
north), the government issues a new decree in 2000 to expand 
the reserve to 42,707 hectares. Logging was still allowed in 
the buffer zones. 
</p>

<p>
The problem of habitat loss in Mexico, however, is far from resolved. Much 
of the land in the Biosphere is loosely owned by local families, who own 
farming rights to many parcels. The local people frequently clear trees for 
farming purposes, as well as for building and firewood.
</p>

<h2>Habitat Loss in North America:</h2>

<p>
North America is experiencing drastic losses in milkweed populations. 
Milkweed often grows naturally along roadsides and in open fields. Milkweeds 
contain glycosides, toxins that can cause sickness in animals, including 
people.* Farmers often clear grazing areas to protect their livestock. 
The sprays they use on the milkweeds eliminate not only the plants, but also 
kill many pollinators that feed from the flowers and plants. Additionally, 
development of land, as well as our human obsession with green lawns, has 
destroyed a great deal of milkweed habitat.
</p>

<h2>Climate Change</h2>

<p>
Climate change poses a long-term threat to the monarch 
migration. A model projecting conditions in the Biosphere in 
2050 show that conditions in the forest which monarchs 
require for their survival will be drastically altered. 
Increases in rainfall and freezing temperatures will render 
the forest unusable to monarchs. The ongoing logging 
operations have so reduced the buffer zone around the 
Biosphere that the butterflies have little protection from 
severe weather events. In recent years, Mexico has 
experienced several severe weather events. Each time, these 
events have drastically reduced the populations of 
overwintering monarch.
