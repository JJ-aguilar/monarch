<h2>Why Use Native Plants?</h2>
<p>
Native plants are extremely important for people who want to support wildlife 
– especially pollinators like birds, bees, and butterflies.  Our native 
wildlife evolved over millions of years with plants that are native to a given 
region. Therefore, wildlife uses native plant communities for food, cover, 
and rearing their young. Many butterfly, moth, and other larva are 
specialists, which means they can only eat and develop on one or two plants. 
If those plants disappear, so will the animals that depend on them. 
</p>

<section>
<p>
The monarch is a good example of a specialist.  While the monarch butterfly 
can nectar on many types of flowers, its caterpillars can only eat milkweed.  
Caterpillars in general are very important to the survival of migratory 
songbirds, since caterpillars are high in protein and comprise 90% of the food 
most birds feed to their young.
</p>

<p>
There are many other reasons to use native plants in your gardens. 
Because native plants are adapted to local soils and climate conditions, they 
generally require less watering and fertilizing than non-natives. Using native 
plants helps preserve the balance and beauty of our ecosystems. Native plants 
are beautiful, and attract “desirable” wildlife like butterflies, bees, and 
hummingbirds. You will be amazed by the visitors to your garden, as your 
plants begin to grow and flourish.
</p>

<p>
*Please note that our native insects do not stress our plants when eating them.
Most plants do not show obvious signs of insect activity. The insects that 
decimate plants are generally non-native insects like gypsy moths and Japanese 
beetles.
