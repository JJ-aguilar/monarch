<h2>Species</h2>
<p>
 Monarchs belong to the class of animals known as insects. Monarchs belong to
 the Order Lepidoptera, which means "scaly wings." This order of animals
 incudes butterflies and moths.</p>

<p>
Most insects eat different food as adults from the food they ate as juveniles.
 The reason native plants are so intrinsic to the health of many pollinators
 is that many have evolved with specific plants, and require those plants for
 survival. Monarch butterflies (and many lepidoptera) feed on flowers as 
adults, using their long proboscises to suck nectar from the plants. Monarch 
caterpillars, on the other hand,are "specialists." 

<a href="file:///home/cventura/Projects/monarch/gallery/pictures/caterpillar.jpg">They can only eat and 
develop from the leaves of milkweed plants.</a>

 A significant drop in the 
milkweed population, therefore, equates to a significant drop in the monarch 
population.

<h2>Why these creatures are important</h2>
<p>All living creatures living in temperate climates must have a strategy to 
survive the winter months. Many insects survive in the warm hollows of leaf 
litter or tree bark. Others overwinter in the soil. Still others overwinter as 
pupa attached to a tree branch or other surface. Eastern North American 
monarchs have developed another strategy: They undertake a 2,000 mile migration 
between Canada and Mexico twice a year.</p>

<p>Their destination is an oyamel fir forest in Michoacan Province, Mexico, 
where they roost in dense colonies in the trees. The oyamel fir forest is 
critical to the monarchsâ€™ survival. It creates a microclimate with the perfect 
overwintering conditions: moist mountain habitat which remains cool without 
freezing. Monarchs cling together in clumps on the trees and leave occasionally
on warm days to get water from nearby sources. Monarchs begin arriving at 
their overwintering site in early November, often coinciding 
with local celebrations of the Day of the Dead on November 1st. Local people 
have long associated the monarchs with the souls of their departed loved ones, 
and the first arrivals are met with great celebration!</p>
