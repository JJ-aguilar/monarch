<p>
 Monarchs belong to the class of animals known as insects. Monarchs belong to the Order Lepidoptera, which means "scaly wings." This order of animals incudes butterflies and moths.
</p>

<p>
Most insects eat different food as adults from the food they ate as juveniles. The reason native plants are so interinsic to the health of many pollinators is that many have evolved with specific plants, and require those plants for survival. Monarch butterflies (and may lepidoptera) feed on flowers as adults, using their long proboscises to suck nectar from the plants. Monarch caterpillars, on the other hand,are "specialists". They can only eat and develop from the leves of
milkweed plants. A singnificant drop in the milkweed population/therefore, equates to a significant drop in the monarch population.

<h2>Butterfly Migration</h2>
<p>
We are working to support the butterflies as they migrate between Canada and
the biosphere in central Mexico. ACC students created a garden to sustain the
monarch butterflies with nectar plants and to provide milkweeds, which are the
one plants the butterfly caterpillars can eat. We have a sister school in
Mexico.  Students there are planting oyamel trees, which are the trees the
monarch overwinter on.
