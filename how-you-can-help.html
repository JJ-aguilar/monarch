<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>
The Arlington Career Center Monarch Garden Project will be so much more 
successful if our neighbors form partnerships with us. You can do this in any 
or all of the following ways:
</p>

<section>
<ul>
<li>Dedicate a small portion of your property to native plants.  
There are so many gorgeous plants which attract desirable wildlife, 
such as migratory songbirds, butterflies, and hummingbirds. 
Native bushes like viburnums require minimal care, but support birds and 
beneficial insects in hundreds of ways.</li>

<li>Talk with your children and neighbors about the importance of wildlife 
conservation.</li>

<li>Ask commercial nurseries where you normally buy plants to carry more 
natives.</li>

<li>Try to eliminate or minimize your use of pesticides and weed killers. 
Pesticides like mosquito sprays and other insect sprays target ALL insects, 
not only the ones listed on the bottles. They contribute to the drops In bees 
and other pollinators, which we are noting throughout the country.</li>

<li>Finally, reduce lawns wherever possible. Treated lawns support virtually 
no wildlife (At least clover supports bees). Reduced lawn area means less 
mowing and healthier pollinators!</li>
</ul>
