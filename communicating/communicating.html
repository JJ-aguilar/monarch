<h1>Communicating with students in Mexico</h1>

<h2> Skype Session with Mexico!</h2>
<p>
In January 2016, students from the Arlington Career Center HILT classes had their first SKYPE session with middle school students in Michoacan Province, Mexico. The school is near the Monarch Biosphere, the famous overwintering site of monarch butterflies. Students in Mexico have been working to restore habitat for monarchs, by planting milkweed and nectar gardens, as well as oyamel saplings. The oyamel forest in the mountains of Mexico provides the perfect climate for monarchs to survive the winter months. Unfortunately, this once large forest has been reduced to Â¼ of its original size, due to illegal logging activity.

HILT students from the Career Center prepared questions to ask the Mexican students. Communication was easy because so many HILT students are native Spanish speakers. The students also translated the responses for students whose native languages are other than Spanish. Students presented a PowerPoint about the Career Center, the Arlington community, and the monarch garden sanctuaries which students and staff have planted outside the Career Center. Mexican students shared photos of their school and gardens. There were lively exchanges about the cultural differences between the school communities, but students in both countries were also surprised to learn that many aspects of their lives are similar.
