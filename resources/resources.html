<h2>Where to Purchase Native Flowers</h2>
<p>
The students at the Career Center wish to encourage other community members to plant native plants. 
It is easy to find and get advice about plants adapted to your growing conditions. There are many
native plant sales in the Northern Virginia area every fall (generally Sept and Oct) and every 
spring (generally April and May). Simply type 
“native plant sales in Northern Virginia” into your search engine. Put your plants into your garden, sit back, 
and watch the droves of songbirds, hummingbirds, and butterflies descend!
