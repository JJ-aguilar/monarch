Classes throughout the Arlington Career Center have worked together to plant
a garden that will sustain pollinators, with a focus on the monarch butterfly.
The monarch butterfly makes an iconic 2,500 mile round-trip journey between
Canada and Mexico every year. Due to factors like pollution, pesticides, and
habitat loss, this migration is in danger of ending. Students at the Career
Center have held two fundraisers to procure money for the materials needed to
plant a monarch garden, and to purchase native plants which will sustain both
the caterpillars and the butterflies along their migration path. Additionally,
students have added native plants to an existing garden outside the main doors
of the Career Center.

<h2>Butterfly Migration</h2>
<p>
We are working to support the butterflies as they migrate between Canada and
the biosphere in central Mexico. ACC students created a garden to sustain the
monarch butterflies with nectar plants and to provide milkweeds, which are the
one plants the butterfly caterpillars can eat. We have a sister school in
Mexico.  Students there are planting oyamel trees, which are the trees the
monarch overwinter on.
